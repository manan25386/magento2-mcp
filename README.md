## Development

### SSL Certificate Verification

For development purposes, the server is configured to bypass SSL certificate verification. In a production environment, you should use proper SSL certificates and remove the `httpsAgent` configuration from the `callMagentoApi` function.

### Adding New Tools

To add new tools, follow the pattern in the existing code. Each tool is defined with:

1. A unique name
2. A description
3. Input parameters with validation using Zod
4. An async handler function that processes the request and returns a response
